DEVELOPER: ANTHONY MULONGO SITUMA
PROJECT: ONLINE ECOMMERCE HONEY SHOP
FRONT END: HTML5, CSS AND JAVA SCRIPT
BACK END: PHP AND MYSQL

This project is a fully functional website that has been designed and compiled using the above languages.
The project has two main sections. The admin section and user’s section. It has a register page, and a login section for authenticating the users. Upon successful login, the users are directly taken to the index page, while the admin is directed to the admin’s section. The registration section is programmed in a way that it can only register users. The admins can only register directly at the back end (but they can login on the same login interface as the users).
The user section has several webpages/interfaces that are well coordinated.

USER SECTION
1.	Index/Homepage: Displays the website’s information and shopping section.
2.	About page: Displays detailed information about the website
3.	Shop page: In this page, shoppers can view products and add them in their wish lists or shopping cart. 
4.	 Order page: In this page, customers make their orders
5.	 Contact page: The page has the websites contact information, and there’s also an interface where users can directly send a message to the admin.
